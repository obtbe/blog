Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by two things: numbers and nature. My grandad, who spent most of his life around horses, had a big hand in that. He’d take me out to the old family stable, where the air always smelled like hay and leather, and teach me how to ride. But it wasn’t just about sitting on a horse. He’d explain the why behind everything. Like how the angle of your body affects the horse’s movement, or how a tiny shift in weight could make all the difference. It was math, but not the kind you’d find in a textbook. It was alive, practical, and tied to the rhythm of the animal beneath you. Those moments stuck with me, and they’re a big part of why I see the world the way I do today.

Thank you for visiting my Blog. I hope you find both the beauty and power of data reflected in its content.
